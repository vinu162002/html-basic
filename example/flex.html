            <p class="first">The common ancestor of extant hummingbirds is estimated to have lived 22 million years 
                ago in South America. They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound 
                created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans.</p>
            <p class="second">he hummingbirds form nine major clades: the topazes 
                and jacobins, the hermits, the mangoes, the coquettes, the brilliants, the giant hummingbird
                (Patagona gigas), the mountaingems, the bees, and the emeralds.</p>
            <p class="third">The topazes and jacobins
                combined have the oldest split with the rest of the hummingbirds. The hummingbird family
                has the third-greatest number of species of any bird family (after the tyrant flycatchers
                and the tanagers)</p>
