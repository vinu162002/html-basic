    <p> Hummingbirds split from their sister group, the swifts and treeswifts, around 42 million 
        years ago. </p>
    <p>The common ancestor of extant hummingbirds is estimated to have lived 22 million years 
        ago in South America. They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound 
        created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans.</p>
    <p> They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per
        second in the largest species to around 80 per second in small hummingbirds. 
        Of those species that have been measured during flying in wind tunnels, their top speeds
        exceed 15 m/s.</p>
    <p>During courtship, some male species dive from 30 metres (100 ft) of height above a 
        female at speeds around 23 m/s (83 km/h; 51 mph).</p>

    <p>In traditional taxonomy, hummingbirds are placed in the order Apodiformes, which also 
        contains the swifts, but some taxonomists have separated them into their own order, 
        the Trochiliformes.</p> <p>Hummingbirds' wing bones are hollow and fragile, making fossilization 
        difficult and leaving their evolutionary history poorly documented. Though scientists 
        theorize that hummingbirds originated in South America, where species diversity is greatest,
         possible ancestors of extant hummingbirds may have lived in parts of Europe and what is southern Russia today.[14]
        Around 360 hummingbirds have been described.</p> <p>They have been traditionally divided into two
         subfamilies: the hermits (subfamily Phaethornithinae) and the typical hummingbirds 
         (subfamily Trochilinae, all the others). Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown, 
         though, that the hermits are sister to the topazes, making the former definition of the 
         Trochilinae not monophyletic.</p> <p>The hummingbirds form nine major clades: the topazes 
        and jacobins, the hermits, the mangoes, the coquettes, the brilliants, the giant hummingbird
        (Patagona gigas), the mountaingems, the bees, and the emeralds.The topazes and jacobins
        combined have the oldest split with the rest of the hummingbirds. The hummingbird family
        has the third-greatest number of species of any bird family (after the tyrant flycatchers
        and the tanagers). </p>
